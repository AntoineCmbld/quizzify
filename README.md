# Quizzify 

Quizzify is a website designed for teachers to easily create and share quizzes online.

\
There are 2 types of users:\
-Student: they can browse quizzes and take them, a note is then assigned to them\
-Teacher: they can browse, take, create, delete and modify their quizzes\
\
For now, you can select your role when creating an account\
\
All passwords are hashed

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
node app.js
```

It will then try to connect to quizzify database on localhost. I did not post SQL querries to reproduce my database, so it will probably crash.
